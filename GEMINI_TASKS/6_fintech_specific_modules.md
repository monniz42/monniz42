# Fintech-specific Modules

The application includes several modules that are specific to fintech applications:

- **Multi-Currency Support**: The presence of a `CurrencyController` suggests that the application supports multiple currencies.
- **Payment Gateways**: The `Gateway` directory contains controllers for multiple payment gateways, including Stripe, Paypal, Razorpay, and more.
- **KYC Verification**: The `KycController` indicates that the application has a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.
- **Withdrawals**: The `WithdrawController` and `WithdrawalController` suggest that users can withdraw funds from their accounts.
- **Admin Panel**: A comprehensive admin panel allows for the management of users, transactions, gateways, and other aspects of the system.
