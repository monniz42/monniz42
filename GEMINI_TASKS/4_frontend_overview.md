# Frontend Overview

The frontend is built using Blade templates, with some potential for Vue.js components (indicated by the presence of `vite.config.js` and `package.json`). The views are located in `resources/views` and are organized into `admin` and `presets/default` directories, suggesting a separation between the admin panel and the user-facing application. The application uses a preset-based theme system, with the `default` preset being the main theme.
